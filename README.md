# Syndo (Συνδώ)
Syndo is a Greek word meaning interconnect or link. It is meant to provide an OpenShift-native way to link
your artifacts to a custom build process without requiring a heavy investment in setup or a large amount
of administrative overhead.

## Components
* [Syndo](./syndo/README.md) - The jar executables for the syndo command line application. Allows Syndo to be used outside of maven.
* [Syndo Maven Plugin](./syndo-maven-plugin/README.md) - Maven plugin that allows execution of Syndo within a maven build
